# funcbench

Benchmark and compare your Go code between commits or sub benchmarks. It automates the use of `go test -bench` to run the benchmarks and uses [benchcmp](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/benchcmp) to compare them.

funcbench currently supports two modes, Local and GitHub. Running it in the Github mode also allows it to accept *a pull request number* and *a branch/commit* to compare against, which makes it suitable for automated tests.

## Environment variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Access token to post benchmarks results to respective PR.

## Usage Examples

> Clean git state is required.

|Usage|Command|
|--|--|
|Execute benchmark named `BenchmarkFuncName` regex, and compare it with `master` branch. | ``` ./funcbench -v master BenchmarkFuncName ``` |
|Execute all benchmarks matching `BenchmarkFuncName.*` regex, and compare it with `master` branch.|```./funcbench -v master BenchmarkFuncName.*```|
|Execute all benchmarks, and compare the results with `devel` branch.|```./funcbench -v devel . ```|
|Execute all benchmarks matching `BenchmarkFuncName.*` regex, and compare it with `6d280faa16bfca1f26fa426d863afbb564c063d1` commit.|```./funcbench -v 6d280faa16bfca1f26fa426d863afbb564c063d1 BenchmarkFuncName.*```|
|Execute all benchmarks matching `BenchmarkFuncName.*` regex on current code. Compare it between sub-benchmarks (`b.Run`) of same benchmark for current commit. Errors out if there are no sub-benchmarks.|```./funcbench -v . FuncName.*```|
|Execute benchmark named `BenchmarkFuncName`, and compare `pr#35` with `master` branch.|```./funcbench --nocomment --github-pr="35" master BenchmarkFuncName```|

## Triggering with GitHub comments

The benchmark can be triggered by creating a comment in a PR which specifies a branch to compare. The results are then posted back to the PR as a comment.
```
/funcbench <branch/commit> <benchmark function regex>
```

The comment is handled by [comment-monitor](https://github.com/prometheus/test-infra/tree/master/tools/commentMonitor) and then the parsed arguments are handed over to funcbench(if using Github Actions) or to [prombench](https://github.com/prometheus/test-infra/tree/master/prombench) if using funcbench with GKE.

## Building Docker container.

From the repository root:

`docker build -t <tag of your choice> -f funcbench/Dockerfile .`
